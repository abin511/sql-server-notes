--公共表表达式（CTE）的主要目的是简化代码，它们与视图类似

--单个CTE的例子
with temp as 
(
	select * from Table_1 where id<100
)
select * from temp;

--带列别名CTE的例子
with temp(编号, 数据) as 
(
	select id, data from Table_1 where id<100
)
select * from temp;

--多个CTE的例子
with temp1 as 
(
	select * from Table_1
), 
temp2 as
(
	select * from Table_2
)
select * from temp1, temp2 where temp1.id = temp2.id;

--带参数的CTE例子
declare @fid int;
set @fid = 1;
with temp as
(
	select * from Table_1 where id = @fid
)
select * from temp;

--CTE实现递归
WITH cte AS (
	SELECT * FROM REGIONINFO AS A(NOLOCK) WHERE A.id = 2
	UNION ALL
	SELECT A.* FROM REGIONINFO AS A(NOLOCK), cte AS B
	WHERE A.pid = B.id
)SELECT * FROM cte
